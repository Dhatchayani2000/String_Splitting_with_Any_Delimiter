Introduction
The StringSplitter class provides a way to split an input string into fields using a user-defined delimiter. It encapsulates this functionality within its methods, making it easy to manage and customize the splitting process.

Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Download or copy the provided StringSplitter class code into a Python file, e.g., string_splitter.py.
Run the Python script using a terminal or command prompt.
Input a delimiter when prompted.
Provide an input string that you want to split.
The program will output the fields of the split string based on the specified delimiter.
Class Details
The class StringSplitter has the following attributes and methods:

Attributes
delimiter: The delimiter used to split the input string into fields. Initialized to None by default.
Methods
__init__(self): Constructor method to initialize the instance. The delimiter attribute is set to None initially.
set_delimiter(self, delimiter): Method to set the delimiter attribute to the provided value.
split_string(self, input_string): Method to split the given input_string into fields using the set delimiter. Raises a ValueError if the delimiter is not set.

Example
Suppose you run the script and input the delimiter ";", and provide the input string "stigwith Delimiter; 1234:split12". The output will be:

css
Copy code
Enter the delimiter: ;
['stigwith Delimiter', ' 1234:split12']

In this case, the input string is split into two fields based on the provided delimiter.
